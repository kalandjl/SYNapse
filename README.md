# SYNapse

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/synapse-toolkit.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/synapse-toolkit)

> A modular Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) toolkit built in Python for advanced network analysis and protocol manipulation.

## Description
SYNapse is a powerful, educational toolkit designed to provide hands-on experience with fundamental network security concepts. It moves beyond high-level frameworks to allow for the direct crafting and manipulation of network packets, providing deep insight into how protocols like ARP, DNS, and HTTP functionâ€”and how they can be subverted.

This tool is built with a clean, modular architecture and is intended for security researchers, students, and network professionals in controlled lab environments. It has native support for Linux-based systems.


## Features
### Version 0.1.0:
 - Functional ARP Spoofer (`spoof` mode)
 - Integrated MitM attack framework (`mitm` mode)
 - Working DNS Spoofer (`dns_spoof` mode)

 ## Installation
 It is highly recommended to run this tool inside a dedicated Linux virtual machine (e.g., Kali Linux).
 SYNapse works in tandem with linux's ```netfilterqueue``` library, along with linux system ```iptables```.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/kalandjl/SYNapse.git](https://github.com/kalandjl/SYNapse.git)
cd SYNapse

# Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install system-level dependencies required for NetfilterQueue
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential python3-dev libnfnetlink-dev libnetfilter-queue-dev

# Install Python package dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the tool in editable mode to make the `syn-apse` command available
pip install -e .

```

## System Prerequisites (Linux)
To enable packet interception and modification, SYNapse requires specific kernel and firewall configurations.

### 1. Enable IP Forwarding
This allows your machine to act as a router for intercepted traffic.

```
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

### 2. Set up ```iptables``` Queue
This rule forwards packets to the ```NFQUEUE``` so your script can process them.
```
sudo iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0
```

### 3. (Optional) Advanced iptables Setup
For a smoother experience on modern networks, this ruleset is recommended:
```
# Allow established connections to bypass the queue
sudo iptables -I FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
# Clamp TCP MSS to prevent MTU issues
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu
```

### IMPORTANT: Cleaning Up
The iptables rules are temporary and will reset on reboot. To clear them manually after you are done, run:
```
sudo iptables --flush
```

## Usage & Commands

All commands require root priviledges. It is recommended to run them with ```sudo -E``` to preserve your environement.

### ```mitm``` 
 
Runs a full Man-in-the-Middle attack, performing an ARP spoof while sniffing traffic.

### Arguments:
 
```-t```, ```--target```: The IP address of the target device.

```-g```, ```--gateway```: The IP address of the network gateway/router.

```-i```, ```--interface```: The network interface to use.

### Example

```
sudo -E syn-apse mitm --target 10.0.0.83 --gateway 10.0.0.1 --interface eth0
```

### ```dns_spoof``` 
 
Performs an ARP spoof to intercept traffic, and then provides forged DNS responses for a target domain.

### Arguments:

```-t```, ```--target```: The IP address of the target device.

```-g```, ```--gateway```: The IP address of the network gateway/router.

```-i```, ```--interface```: The network interface to use.

```-d```, ```--domain``` The domain to spoof.

### Example

```
sudo -E syn-apse dns-spoof -t 10.0.0.83 -g 10.0.0.1 -i eth0 -d example.com --spoof-ip 10.0.0.1

```

### ```sniff```
 
  Captures and displays live packets on a specified network interface.

### Arguments:

```-i```, ```--interface```: The network interface to use.
```-f```, ```--filter```: BPF filter for sniffing (e.g., 'tcp port 80').
```-c```, ```--count```: Number of packets to capture (0 for unlimited).

### Example

```
sudo -E syn-apse sniff --interface eth0 --filter "udp port 53" --count 10
```
